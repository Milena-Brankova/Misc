		<p>There were 100 students and 100 lockers in a school.</p>
		<p>The first student opened all the lockers. The second student closed every second locker. The third student went to every third locker and opened it (if it was closed) or closed it (if it was open). Let's call this action processing a locker. Next students continued processing every nth locker on pass number n. After 100 passes, where 100th student processed only locker #100, how many lockers were open?</p>
